## Projects

This repository contains the following projects:

1. **0x00-python_variable_annotations**  
   Introduction to type annotations and type hints in Python.

2. **0x01-python_async_function**  
   Learning about asynchronous programming using `async` and `await`.

3. **0x02-python_async_comprehension**  
   Deep dive into asynchronous comprehensions in Python.

4. **0x03-unittests_and_integration_tests**  
   Writing unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.

5. **0x04-pagination**  
   Implementing pagination in Python for handling large datasets in APIs.

6. **0x05-personal_data**  
   Managing and protecting personal data, and working with the logging module.

7. **0x06-Basic_authentication**  
   Implementing basic authentication systems in web applications.

8. **0x07-Session_authentication**  
   Managing user sessions and session-based authentication.

9. **0x08-User_authentication**
