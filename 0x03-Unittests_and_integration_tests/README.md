# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

## Project Overview

This project is focused on learning and implementing unit tests and integration tests in Python. It covers key concepts such as writing test cases, using testing frameworks, and understanding the differences between unit tests and integration tests. The goal is to ensure that software components function as expected through both isolated tests and tests that validate the interaction between components.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the importance of testing in software development.
- Write unit tests to test individual components of a system.
- Understand the differences between unit tests and integration tests.
- Use Python's built-in `unittest` framework to perform both types of tests.
- Automate testing with continuous integration tools.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of Python programming and object-oriented design.
- Familiarity with functions and methods.

```

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, navigate to the tests/ directory and execute the following command:
```
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

This command will automatically find and run all the test cases in the tests/ directory.

## Running Integration Tests

To run the integration tests, navigate to the integration_tests/ directory and execute:
```
python -m unittest discover integration_tests/
```

## Project Files

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are written using Python's unittest framework. The unit tests test individual functions, classes, or methods to ensure they behave as expected. Each test is isolated, ensuring that a failure in one test doesn't affect others.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests validate the interactions between components. These tests ensure that different parts of the system work together as intended. Integration tests often involve testing external systems like databases or APIs.

## Requirements File

The requirements.txt file contains all the necessary dependencies for the project. Install them using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Main Script

The main.py script contains the core functionality of the project, and test cases should be written to ensure its correct behavior.
