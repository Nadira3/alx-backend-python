# Async Comprehension Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous comprehensions in Python to efficiently handle multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently. It leverages the `asyncio` library to create and manage asynchronous operations, allowing for improved performance when dealing with I/O-bound tasks, such as fetching data from web APIs or reading files.

## Features

- Uses `asyncio` for asynchronous programming in Python.
- Demonstrates the use of `asyncio.gather()` to run multiple async tasks concurrently.
- Implements async comprehensions to collect results efficiently.
- Handles exceptions gracefully using the `return_exceptions` parameter in `asyncio.gather()`.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.7 or higher. Ensure you have the required packages installed. You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install aiohttp
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd async-comprehension-project
```

2. Run the main script:
```
python main.py
```
Make sure to replace main.py with the name of your main Python file if it's different.

### Examples

Fetching Data from URLs

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch data concurrently from multiple URLs using async comprehensions:
```
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_url(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def main():
    urls = [
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1",
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2",
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3"
    ]
    
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        results = [await fetch_url(session, url) for url in urls]
        for result in results:
            print(result[:100])  # Print the first 100 characters of each response

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Error Handling with asyncio.gather()

Here's how you can handle exceptions when using asyncio.gather():
```
async def task_with_error(name):
    if name == "error":
        raise ValueError("An error occurred")
    return f"Task {name} completed"

async def main():
    tasks = [task_with_error("A"), task_with_error("B"), task_with_error("error")]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
```
